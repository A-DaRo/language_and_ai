<p class="right"><span class="keep-together"><em>A language is not just words. It’s a culture, a tradition,</em></span> <span class="keep-together"><em>a unification of a community,</em></span> <span class="keep-together"><em>a whole history that creates what a community is.</em></span>

<p>Imagine a hypothetical person, John Doe. He’s the CTO of a fast-growing technology startup. On a busy day, John wakes up and has this conversation with his digital <span class="keep-together">assistant:</span></p>

<p><em>John:</em> “How is the weather today?”</p>

<p><em>Digital assistant:</em> “It is 37 degrees centigrade outside with no rain today.”</p>

<p><em>John:</em> “What does my schedule look like?”</p>

<p><em>Digital assistant:</em> “You have a strategy meeting at 4 p.m. and an all-hands at 5:30 p.m. Based on today’s traffic situation, it is recommended you leave for the office by <span class="keep-together">8:15 a.m.”</span></p>

<p><em>While he’s getting dressed, John probes the assistant on his fashion choices:</em></p>

<p><em>John:</em> “What should I wear today?”</p>

<p><em>Digital assistant:</em> “White seems like a good choice.”</p>

<p>You might have used smart assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Apple Siri to do similar things. We talk to these assistants not in a programming language, but in our natural language—the language we all communicate in. This natural language has been the primary medium of communication between humans since time immemorial. But computers can only process data in binary, i.e., 0s and 1s. While we can represent language data in binary, how do we make machines understand the <span class="keep-together">language?</span> This is where natural language processing (NLP) comes in.

their introduction in 2017, transformers have quickly become the dominant architecture for achieving state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks. If you're a data scientist or coder, this practical book -now revised in full color- shows you how to train and scale these large models using Hugging Face Transformers, a Python-based deep learning library. Transformers have been used to write realistic news stories, improve Google Search queries, and even create chatbots that tell corny jokes. In this guide, authors Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf, among the creators of Hugging Face Transformers, use a hands-on approach to teach you how transformers work and how to integrate them in your applications. You'll quickly learn a variety of tasks they can help you solve. Build, debug, and optimize transformer models for core NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering Learn how transformers can be used for cross-lingual transfer learning Apply transformers in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce Make transformer models efficient for deployment using techniques such as distillation, pruning, and quantization Train transformers from scratch and learn how to scale to multiple GPUs and distributed environments\",\"identifier\":\"9781098136789\",\"issued\":\"2022-05-26\",\"ourn\":\"urn:orm:book:9781098136789\",\"model\":\"recommendations_usage_based\",\"score\":0.892732799,\"title\":\"Natural Language Processing with Transformers, Revised Edition\",\"uiFormat\":\"book\",\"uri\":\"/library/view/-/9781098136789/\"},{\"apiUrl\":\"/api/v1/book/9781098150952/\",\"authors\":[\"Jay Alammar\",\"Maarten Grootendorst\"],\"contentFormat\":\"book\",\"continueUri\":\"/api/v1/continue/9781098150952/\",\"coverUri\":\"/library/cover/9781098150952/\",\"description\":\"AI has acquired startling new language capabilities in just the past few years.
