The lecture material is not self-contained; I provide supplementary material for further reading, which are in the form of [books](#reference-texts), and [course-specific reading material](#recommended-articles) (structured by week).

## 📗 Reference Texts

---

| Our main driver for reading will be the following (online) book: |
| :--- |
| *   **[Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft august 24)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/old_aug24)** |
| Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin |

> 💡 The second edition is available as a physical purchase. It's a really good source if you're interested in NLP, but difficult to come by, does not feature an extensive DNN chapter, and we will only cover a small portion.

## 📰 Recommended Articles

> ‼️ Please note that this section may be updated on a weekly basis. Check back regularly!

> ℹ️ From certain books we only use a few pages, and some articles are not open-access. You could buy them. I'm sure that would make the publishers very happy. What they would not want you to do, is copy the DOI and paste it into services such as sci-hub to get free access to those sources. They might get mad. Anyway, where were we?
