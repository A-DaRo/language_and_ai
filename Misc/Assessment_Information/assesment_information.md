## 💻 Interim Assignment (40%)

***

> **💡** More detail and helpful information regarding the interim assignment is provided throughout the quartile in the [in-person lectures](https://example.com/in-person-lectures). The information below should give you a good idea about what to expect.

### ℹ️ General

***

The interim assignment comprises writing a research paper and code producing its results. It is recommended you complete the assignments in groups of 4 (this is also the maximum group size). Needless to say, it is **Open Book (etc);** you can use the course material, the Internet, LLMs (see below)—you name it. Anything but fellow students that are not in your group.

### 🚛 Logistics

***

The deadline is [Friday the 09th of January 17:00](https://example.com/assignment-deadline). You can work on it for this entire period.

> **‼️** The assignment hand-in page will remain open after the deadline; however, the penalty for late submission is a [2% grade reduction](https://example.com/late-penalty) for each additional late day (this applies to each group member equally). Only regular workdays (mo-fri until 17:00) count as late days. Suppose the deadline is Friday 5PM, this implies that handing in anywhere before Monday 5PM counts as [one day](https://example.com/late-day-count) late.

### 🏢 Paper Structure

***

The research paper is to be written using the ACL template:

[ACL Style Files GitHub Repository: Official style files for papers submitted to venues of the Association for Computational Linguistics](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)

*   $\LaTeX$ (recommended!) [template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) or [via Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)

The research paper should generally follow conventional structuring with an introduction, a related work section, an experimental setup section, results, and a discussion/conclusion. More details on how to approach each section will follow.

### 🧑‍💻 Code Structure

***

Lab Session 1 covers Object-Oriented Programming. Make use of it. Document your code. We will provide suggestions on how to do so throughout. We’d love it if you track and make your work available through a GitHub repository (or a similar service), but this is not required to any extent. As long as you provide a `README.md` file with the code that clearly discusses how to run and verify your results you are in the clear. Please see Week 5’s [lab session](https://mctenthij.notion.site/29d979eeca9f811b9b9bd7fa17e49310?pvs=25) for further recommendations.

### ⛳ Expectations

***

The lectures will provide you with starting points to work on the provided task; you may stick to those and correctly implement them. However, in addition to being expected to apply scripts and tools covered during the lab sessions, you are very much encouraged to extend them for a higher grade. You’re expected to keep up with the lab assignments and exercises. The idea is your group works on it every week and you have questions ready for the lab sessions. Starting late will significantly reduce your chances to get input on ideas you may have during those sessions.

### 👥 Group Work

***

We will open a ‘group-matching’ Discussion board in the first week of the course to promote yourself and find team members if you struggle to find them in class. We recommend that you give a brief description of your strengths, and, matched online or not, to construct a balanced team. You may require members to fill one or more roles such as: having a good grasp of machine learning, being able to program well, excelling in data processing and/or visualization, data visualization skills, being a solid writer, a critic, and a project manager. A research paper is a highly multi-facetted endeavor. So, try to leverage each other’s unique skills as much as possible.

> **ℹ️** Given the above, we will ask for a statement of what each team member contributed to the project. Team members will typically get the same grade, but we may differentiate in extreme cases of unequal contribution. You can contact us in confidence in the event of unequal contribution. Please see the [relevant section](https://mctenthij.notion.site/29d979eeca9f81c8922cc935bc4aeb70?pvs=25#29d979eeca9f81be88d6db43e3464628) under asking questions.

### 🤖 (Automated) Plagiarism

***

Assignments will be checked for plagiarism; not only the writing, the code too. The easiest way to avoid issues is by doing your own work. This means: make sure your writing is your own. Copy-pasting and paraphrasing particular words does not count as making it your own writing. Read, synthesize, write anew. Similarly, we do not recommend copying code off the Internet verbatim, or ‘borrowing’ code from other students not in your group. Both significantly increase the chances of potential plagiarism. If you do use academic work in writing, or repositories in code, make sure to cite them (in the document as a reference, or in the comments as a link).

> **🦜** On the use of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as ChatGPT and variants): how ever much I’d like you to encourage you to pursue your own intellectual endeavors, I am not under the illusion that I can ban you from using LLMs for your work. Feel free to use them. While doing so, however, please realize that the chances of overlap with other students using LLMs is rather high. This may potentially become a plagiarism issue between groups. Additionally, please refrain from using LLMs to ‘improve’ your writing. The research paper is not expected to be written in fancy academic English. Succinct and to the point is good; typically not something that LLMs do all that well. If you want to use them to correct spelling and grammar: no issues there. In Week 7 we’ll talk about the ethical implications of LLMs, and hopefully you’ll have a nuanced view on their usage by the end of the course. That’s a bit premature to expect at the start, though. 🙂

### ▶️ Assignment Instructions

***

Instructions can be found here:

[📓 Interim Assignment](../Interim_Assignment/index.html)

All rubric components adhere to the following point range:

*   10 to >8.0 pts: Excellent
*   8 to >6.0 pts: Good
*   6 to >5.0 pts: Acceptable
*   5 to >0 pts: Poor to Unacceptable

Not all subcomponents have to be passing for a passing grade.

> **❗** The rubric may be subject to change (we will note if changes happen, but they will likely not be significant). Here is last year’s as an example of what to expect.

| Component | Description | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Correctness of the Implementation** | The experimental setup is appropriate including the right description of the data, appropriate pre-processing of the data, evaluation, and parameters. Excellent papers will have robust analyses, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. They clearly describe the data being used and the method to produce the results. | 10 pts |
| **Interpretation** | Understanding of the task is clear, research questions / hypotheses have been appropriately formulated, and the discussion is clear-sighted about the implication of the results and the research its limitations. An excellent paper has a well-structured introduction, a clear results section, and a discussion section that provides context and answers to the research questions / hypotheses, considers the research and tasks limitations, and provides avenues for future work. | 10 pts |
| **Presentation** | Excellent writing quality is evidenced by clear logic and careful attention to reasoning of points. There are no grammar or other mistakes. The paper is of an appropriate length (4 pages excluding reference section and authorship statement). Appropriate sources are included. Figures and tables are high quality with self-contained captions. Figures and tables are used to allow the reader to understand the data and the results. | 10 pts |
| **Reproducibility** | Code and documentation (of the classes / functions, and the code base itself) is appropriate for the presented research and connects with the results in the paper. Excellent reproducibility entails a user running the code on their machine will see output matching the paper. Suggestions for extending the code repository and running it on different data are provided as well. | 10 pts |
| **Creativity** | The method and analyses in the paper expand adequately upon the material discussed in the lecture (both theory and task-related). Excellent creativity is evidenced by thought-provoking qualitative analyses, visualizations, the use of more advanced or interpretable models, detailed error analyses or bias assessment. | 10 pts |

## 📑 Exam (60%)

***

The exam is a Schoolyear ANS exam, which will [not be fully open book](https://example.com/not-open-book). In addition to your standard equipment, you are allowed to bring:

*   A single sheet of A4 paper worth of notes. This can be double-sided, in any font size you can still read. Equations will be given on the exam.
*   You can bring a **standard** scientific (i.e., without graphing and/or programmable capabilities) calculator.

### 📚 Exam Content

***

*   **Video Lectures**: you are expected to understand, and to be able to apply the material in the lectures (and therefore the book) in similar detail, unless specified otherwise in the lectures.
    *   > **💡** Please note this implies that topics and algorithms in the book that are not discussed in the lecture are not part of the exam!
*   **Exercises**: additional exercises have been provided for working through the different algorithms. You may expect any of these (or at least their subcomponents, especially the more time-intensive ones) on the exam (with different values of course).
*   **In-Person Lectures and** **Lab Sessions**: these cover contextual content to the application of the material. Hence, you are expected to be largely familiar with the additional information provided. You are not expected to write any code on the exam, however!
    *   > **💡** Week 7’s in-person lecture discusses reading that is part of the exam, so this part should receive some additional attention while studying. Generally, you can expect the lab and in-person content to be supplementary and hence useful to answering questions. However, the exam’s focus is largely on the [video lecture](https://example.com/video-lecture-focus) content.
*   **Readings**: The book is exam material (but see **Lectures** bullet point). In general, the reading materials (papers) provided per week are [supplementary](https://example.com/supplementary-readings) and hence their literal contents (i.e., what they provide as additional information) are [not part of the exam](https://example.com/readings-not-exam). The only exception are papers explicitly marked to be exam material (these will also be discussed in lectures).

### ✍️ Question Style

***

*   The exam consists of multiple choice, calculation (answer in box with one value/vector, [full calculation does not need to be provided](https://example.com/no-full-calculation)), and essay-style questions (answer in writing in an answer box; length of the box *should* be sufficient). This order is from most to least occurring (typically there are 22 questions, 2 of which are open worth 5 points, ~5 are calculation questions worth 1 pt, and the rest is MC worth 1 pt).
*   Roughly 1/3 of the questions will be about theory, 1/3 of the questions will be about algorithms, and 1/3 of the questions will be about applications and insights.
*   Points will be noted per question. For the multiple-choice questions, only one answer is correct.

The questions might, for example, look like (but are not limited to) such:

*   **Theory**: given some statements about a single concept (e.g., ambiguity, semantics, bias): choose which one applies — or, given a concept, explain its use and limitations.
*   **Algorithms**: given several descriptions of algorithm functionality: choose which one holds for a particular algorithm — or, given (part of) an algorithm and an input: calculate the correct numerical outcome ([typically a value or a vector](https://example.com/calculation-output)).
*   **Applications / insights**: given a description of some data science use case: choose/motivate what the best NLP pipeline would be — or, given some limitation of a corpus: choose/motivate what the effect would be on a certain task.
*   **Essay-style**: given a particular algorithm, describe how its performance may improved in a specific setting through use of techniques from other parts of the course.

### 🏋️ Mock Exam

***

You can find a mock exam below. Please read the disclaimers carefully:

[🏋️ Mock Exam](./Mock_Exam/mock_exam.md)

### 🔎 After the Exam

***

Grades will be up as soon as possible (but within 15 working days at the latest). Shortly after, we will announce details about the window for [remote](https://example.com/remote-inspection) inspection via ANS. Note that the content of the exam is submitted to careful analysis before grades are posted (checks for mistakes, appropriateness, etc.). Hence, the inspection is intended to offer transparency regarding the grading, not to start an argument about it. Only in extraordinary cases are arguments not in vain.

### ⁉️ Questions About the Exam

***

If you have any questions about the [content](https://example.com/exam-content-questions) of the exam, please use the dedicated exam Discussion page. I can’t answer questions about anything else (see [here](https://mctenthij.notion.site/29d979eeca9f81c8922cc935bc4aeb70?pvs=25#29d979eeca9f8113b388e84c75be91cb)).
